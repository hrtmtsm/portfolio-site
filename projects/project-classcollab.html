                  <h1>Forming Compatible Student Teams for Better Outcomes</h1>

                  <p>
                    <strong
                      >Students often struggle with mismatched project
                      teams</strong
                    >, which can lead to unclear goals, uneven workloads, and
                    poor collaboration. This project tackled that challenge by
                    creating a
                    <strong>smarter team formation process</strong> that matches
                    students based on shared goals, working styles, and
                    availability, while also supporting stronger course outcomes
                    for instructors and institutions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Using Lean UX principles,
                    <span class="underline-subtle">I conducted</span> secondary
                    research, built rapid prototypes, and validated ideas
                    directly with users through multiple iterations. This
                    approach helped shape a solution that maximizes both
                    <strong>user outcomes</strong> and
                    <strong>business value</strong>.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Students often get assigned to teams randomly or based on
                  superficial criteria like social ties, which frequently
                  results in poor collaboration, unclear expectations, and
                  uneven workload distribution. Instructors also lack time and
                  data to form balanced groups, and existing tools fail to
                  prioritize compatibility in working preferences and project
                  goals.

                  The business goal for this project is to help students
                  experience better collaboration and achieve stronger project
                  outcomes, which in turn raises overall course satisfaction. In
                  the long run, this contributes to a stronger academic
                  reputation, higher student retention, and improved
                  institutional results. We’ll know we’re successful when we see
                  indicators such as higher team satisfaction, more balanced
                  workload distribution, better project outcomes, and fewer
                  requests for team changes among our target users.

                Team Formation Practices Overlook Compatibility and Balance
              </h2>

              <p>
                To define the problem space, I reviewed academic literature on
                team formation in education. The key takeaway was that team
                compatibility, especially in terms of collaboration preferences,
                goals, and availability, plays a significant role in project
                outcomes and student satisfaction. This led me to focus on the
                idea that early-stage team formation should align mindsets
                rather than rely only on skill matching. That insight shaped the
                decision to use lightweight data inputs such as collaboration
                styles and project goals during onboarding.

                      Letting students
                      <strong>freely choose teammates</strong> too early can
                      lead to <strong>poor matches</strong>. Forming groups with
                      balanced skills can reduce friction and improve
                      collaboration.

                      Current group formation is often inefficient and
                      <strong>relies too much on chance</strong>. Using goals,
                      strengths, and availabilitycould help automate better
                      matches.

                Students Who Need Better Group Work
              </h2>
              <p>
                To ground the solution in real student needs, I developed two
                proto-personas: Alex, a third-year computer science
                undergraduate, and Rachel, a second-year cognitive science
                graduate student. Despite their differences in academic level
                and goals, both struggle with mismatched teams, unclear
                expectations, and uneven workloads. Alex wants to build strong
                portfolio projects with like-minded peers, while Rachel seeks
                meaningful research partnerships. Together, these personas show
                how the solution can support diverse students and highlight the
                need for compatibility, transparency, and student agency in team
                formation.

              <p>
                This product helps students form groups that are
                <strong>aligned</strong> with their goals, work styles, and
                availability. By matching students intentionally, it makes group
                work more effective and less stressful.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Align goals and interests</strong> to boost motivation
                  and reduce conflict.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Combine strengths</strong> so students feel more
                  confident contributing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Match projects</strong> to personal or professional
                  interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Set clear expectations</strong> upfront to avoid
                  confusion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improve collaboration</strong> for better performance
                  and satisfaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Save time and reduce stress</strong> by preventing
                  last-minute team reshuffling.

              <p>
                I used Pirate Metrics in the early stage of the process
                <strong>to validate whether the MVP was necessary</strong>. At
                this stage, I <strong>focused on acquisition</strong> and
                understanding the user funnel, looking at how students
                discovered, signed up for, and engaged with the platform.After
                observing retention and consistent usage, I incorporated
                Outcome-to-Impact Mapping, I incorporated Outcome-to-Impact
                Mapping to explore the broader educational and institutional
                value. This phased approach helped me test user behavior early
                and assess long-term impact after building a foundation of
                engagement.

                Based on the HMW question, I used a design studio exercise with

              <p>
                After mapping possible solutions to both business goals and user
                needs, I prioritized them based on their potential value and
                associated risk to decide which hypothesis to validate first.
                This helped me focus on an idea that balanced impact with
                feasibility and offered the best chance for meaningful early
                results.

              <p>
                When prioritizing the hypotheses, I identified risky assumptions
                and how to validate each one. This helped me start small, test
                critical assumptions early, and define next steps to build
                solutions that truly matched student needs. After evaluating all
                concepts, I decided to prioritize the Onboarding Survey because
                it presented <strong>low risk and high value</strong>, making it
                suitable for achieving a <strong>quick win</strong> during the
                MVP stage. This approach could
                <strong>leverage existing data sources</strong> such as
                students' skills, grades, and past project performance to
                improve team compatibility and reduce reliance on self-reported
                preferences.

              <p>
                Based on the hypothesis prioritization, I decided to start with
                an idea that offered high perceived value and low risk, aiming
                for a quick win. I chose to first validate a foundational
                assumption: “Students care about being matched with compatible
                teammates.”
                <strong
                  >This assumption is subjective but critical as it underpins
                  all other project ideas and hypotheses</strong
                >. If students are not concerned with team dynamics, investing
                further in compatibility-focused features may be irrelevant.
                Validating this early allows us to reduce risk and build
                confidence before exploring additional solutions.

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>To test early interest and engagement</strong>, I
                  built a simple MVP landing page with a clear CTA: “Start the
                  team match survey.” The button linked to an embedded
                  onboarding survey to simulate the experience. Instead of just
                  asking if users were interested, I tracked real behavior to
                  get unbiased insights. I also included a short survey to gauge
                  interest, collect basic demographics like major and student
                  level, and check if they had used similar tools before. I
                  shared the landing page with students in my HCI program and a
                  few product and design communities to gather diverse input.
                  This helped me spot opportunities, clarify expectations, and
                  see how familiar they were with existing solutions.

                <p>
                  I tested early interest and engagement with a simple MVP
                  landing page and a clear CTA, which brought in
                  <strong>13 unique visitors</strong> and
                  <strong>8 unique clicks</strong>, resulting in a
                  <strong>60% click-through rate</strong>. All participants
                  reported they had never used similar tools before, and
                  <strong>5 out of 8</strong> shared they had struggled to form
                  groups in the past and were somewhat interested in this idea.
                  However, their mixed answers to “What do you think the website
                  is trying to solve?” and feedback asking for more context
                  showed that the value proposition needed to be clearer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As the next step, I created a clickable prototype with the
                  actual onboarding questionnaire to test whether students would
                  complete the process and better understand the concept and
                  value behind the project.

                The landing page test showed early interest in the idea, but it
                also revealed that a simple static page wasn’t enough to
                communicate how the product would actually work. To address
                this, I created an interactive prototype that demonstrated the
                onboarding and matching flows.
                <strong
                  >This step not only made the concept more tangible, but also

                process. With the prototype, I could observe how students
                interacted with the flow and whether the team formation
                experience felt meaningful in practice.

                      their goals, preferred collaboration style, strengths, and
                      project interests. The system uses this information to
                      suggest team configurations that prioritize shared goals
                      and compatible working styles. Once a team is confirmed,
                      the student can view a team overview with brief profiles

                <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
                <h4>1. Onboarding Content Grounded in Insights</h4>
                <p>
                  Survey responses and research by Lopez et al. (2021) and Odo
                  et al. (2019) highlighted challenges like mismatched work
                  styles, unclear direction, and poor timing. These informed the
                  onboarding quiz design, which includes questions about project
                  goals, collaboration preferences, and typical team roles. The
                  goal was to make the process lightweight yet meaningful enough
                  to support more compatible and balanced team formation.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Need for Clearer Concept Communication</h4>
                <p>
                  When asked what the site was trying to solve, participants
                  gave answers like “teammate finding system” or “help students
                  create project teams.” One response revealed confusion,
                  indicating the need for clearer communication. This insight
                  directly led to developing an interactive prototype to show
                  onboarding and team matching in action.
                </p>

                <h4>3. No Familiarity with Similar Tools</h4>
                <p>
                  None of the participants had used a team formation tool
                  before. While this didn’t signal high demand, it reinforced
                  the need to design a simple, intuitive experience that works
                  without requiring prior tool familiarity.

                <h3>Participants</h3>
                <p>
                  I tested with seven graduate students who have participated in
                  team-based projects, such as those in computer science or
                  product design, and are familiar with the team formation
                  process.

                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <p>
                  In the previous phase, all eight participants expressed
                  moderate interest in the concept. While the sample size was
                  small, the feedback was generally positive and encouraging.
                  The previous round focused on concept validation through a
                  landing page and survey. In this phase, I wanted to move
                  beyond initial interest and assess
                  <strong
                    >whether users could understand and engage with the value,
                    flow, and functionality of the product.</strong
                  >
                  Specifically, I aimed to test if users could complete the
                  onboarding flow, understand the team matching process, and
                  feel confident moving forward after joining a group.

                    ><br />
                    I wanted to see whether the prompts (e.g., collaboration
                    style, project goals) feel relevant and easy to answer, or
                    if users need more context or examples.

                      satisfying?</strong
                    ><br />
                    I observed whether users feel confident in selecting a group
                    and whether the confirmation and handoff to the team
                    overview provide a strong sense of closure.

                    I tested whether surfacing teammate info like roles and
                    availability encourages early engagement, or if users still
                    feel hesitant to initiate contact.

                      All seven participants from the target population
                      successfully completed the onboarding questionnaire tasks.
                      The System Usability Scale (SUS) score averaged 82.5,
                      indicating strong perceived usability.

                      The fact that all participants were able to complete the
                      onboarding without dropping off or needing assistance
                      suggests that the onboarding flow is intuitive and
                      well-structured. This outcome supports the second risky
                      assumption: that students are both willing and able to
                      complete the onboarding process when it helps them form
                      better-matched teams. The high SUS score further confirms
                      that the current design supports ease of use and user
                      satisfaction.

                    <p>
                      Given the high SUS score and 100% task completion rate,
                      the current onboarding experience appears to be effective
                      for the MVP stage. No critical usability barriers were
                      identified, so the basic navigation and interaction
                      patterns can be retained.

            <h2>Reflection & If We Had More Time</h2>
            <h3>Quick and Dirty, Then Iterate</h3>
            <p>
              I tackled this project by developing new concepts and features
              step by step. Throughout the design process, I started small,
              validated ideas and functions with users, and then moved on to the
              next iteration. This approach helped me iterate effectively and
              shape the solution to what users actually need, quickly.
            </p>

            <h3>Business Point of View</h3>
            <p>
              As I designed, I aimed to maximize business outcomes as well as
              user outcomes while addressing real problems people face. This
              point of view helped me not only solve problems for users but also
              support business growth through design.
            </p>

            <h3>Future Iterations</h3>
            <p>
              I would run another round of usability testing to check whether
              the changes I made were effective. After that, I’d validate the
              risky assumption that “compatibility based on goals, past
              projects, and skills leads to well-formed teams and improved
              satisfaction.”
